            <h3>&#x2022; Leadership Experience: Team Lead at a Non-Profit Organization</h3>
          
            <p> As a Team Lead at a non-profit organization focused on environmental conservation, I
              led a team of volunteers in planning and executing 
              community clean-up campaigns. My responsibilities included coordinating schedules, assigning tasks, and
              ensuring effective communication 
              within the team. I demonstrated leadership skills by motivating team members, providing guidance, and
              fostering a collaborative environment.
              Through this experience, I developed strong organizational and interpersonal skills while making a positive
              impact on the community.</p>

            <h3>&#x2022; Volunteering Experience: Mentor for Youth Development Program</h3>
          
            <p> I volunteered as a mentor in a youth development program aimed at empowering
                underprivileged teenagers. I provided guidance, support, and mentorship
                to help them develop essential life skills, set goals, and overcome challenges. This involved conducting
                one-on-one mentoring sessions, organizing workshops 
                on career development, and facilitating group activities to promote teamwork and personal growth. This
                experience allowed me to make a difference in the lives 
                of young individuals, honed my communication and mentoring abilities, and deepened my understanding of
                diverse
                backgrounds and perspectives
